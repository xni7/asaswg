## ASA Biopharm Safety Working Group (SWG)

**Mission**:  Empower the biostatistics community and interdisciplinary safety management partnerships  to better enable qualitative and quantitative safety evaluation throughout drug development life cycle

Our **goals** are to:

- Encourage increased use of systematic safety assessment approaches
- Where appropriate, develop new methods to address the existing safety challenges
- Educate the broader statistical community to understand and contribute to this important area
- Increase statisticiansâ€™ leadership roles in cross-functional collaboration
- Communicate statistical perspectives to larger clinical trial community

The SWG consists of three workstreams (WS), which are general scope and relatively long-term.

- WS1: Interdisciplinary safety evaluation 
- WS2: Safety monitoring statistical methodology
- WS3: integration and bridging the RWE and RCT for safety decision making
- Each workstream includes several task forces (TF), which are deliverable-based and time-bounded.
